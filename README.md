# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
I created a program that read a list of grocery items from a file and kept a record of the number of times each item occurred in the file.

# What did I do particularly well?
I think what I did pretty well is I kept the program concise and readable; and small. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My program is barely object-oriented because it's small. If I were to improve the code somehow I would go more in the object-oriented direction.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I used iterators for a lot of my solutions and those weren't covered in the class so it was a bit of a challenge. However, I thought it was a good solution to my problems.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I did a lot of things in the project I think were good. I used a map and encapsulated it in a class, used iterators, and kept the program small and readable. It probably would be easy to extend the program as well.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I kept the program small, encapsulated the map inside a class, used comments, and used readable naming for variables and functions.
